### It can take up to 1 minute to add a device as we are sending messages every 5 minutes.

Disclaimer: October has been a heavy month for console updates on the Helium platform, devices could be down, but we are up for Zoom 1 on 1 testing for judges!

Update for 10/27/2021: We have been having intermitent server disconnects (403) by our cloud provider which is AWS. Switched to AWS europe. This is why we need to decentralize xD. Everything is normal by now.

Update for 11/17/2021: The Helium Network is down, we will update when it comes back up, the developers are working hard at it. For now our services are halted.

# Kharon-Protocol-Testing:

## Please watch out video demo of an IoT device going through the steps to join Kharon!

Welcome to the testing section of Kharon Protocol, in this section you can find the steps to configure Kharon protocol in Helium console.

Previous Requirements:

- A [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/) account with some data credits to burn.
- Have a LoRaWAN device which can connect to the Helium network (in the case of this tutorial it will be a Pycom Board).
- A Phantom Wallet: https://phantom.app/

If you don't have a device or time at hand to go through this process we are running a couple devices at all times through our system to debug and test.
Such as these ones:

If you happen to have one of this (ST Helium Developer Kit: st MB1296D)  and you know your workaround the helium console, you can upload this code: https://github.com/altaga/Kharon-Protocol/tree/main/Testing/TESTINGHeliumdevkit

Here are the credentials of one of them if you just need a quick check on the functionality on our platform:

Dev EUI: FF80A252597BD5D6

App EUI: 62737802A0F72A24

Disclaimer: It can take up to 1 minute to add a device as we are sending messages every 30 seconds.

# Device Setup:

This step is not directly a configuration of our protocol, if you already have configured your device in the Helium network, please go to the [Integration Setup](#integration-setup) section.

## Create an account
To register for an account, visit [Helium Console](https://console.helium.com/)

During registration, you'll be asked to provide an Organization name for the top level owner of the account (i.e. company name).

<img src="https://docs.helium.com/img/use-the-network/console/console-register.png">

A confirmation email will be sent to the email address used to create an account. You must confirm the account in order to continue using Console. If you did not receive an email, please check your spam folders.

## Add a Device:
Helium Console allows developers to add devices and grab the device identifiers to load onto their device firmware that authenticates and identifies the device for the Helium Network.

To add a device, go to Devices and click the + Add Device icon on the top right of the window.

<img src="https://docs.helium.com/img/use-the-network/console/console-add-device.png">

DevEUI, AppEUI, and AppKey are auto generated by the Helium Console when you create a new device. Save these values for the next section.

# Integration Setup:

From kharonprotocol.com, we launch the application.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/m58dZPK/setup-1.png">

To add a device or see our devices we must connect our wallet, in this case the phantom wallet.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0ByBF87/setup-3.png">

We go to the add device section, it will ask us for the AppEUI and DevEUI, but first we must configure the integration within our Helium console.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2vtNWRN/setup-4.png">

Inside the Helium console we must go to the integrations section.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/h2XgZWr/setup-5.png">

We press the button with the + sign.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/8PVpMwm/setup-6.png">

We are going to add an HTTP coustom integration.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bv2zqjc/setup-7.png">

We will put the URI of our integration.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/R6zL78X/setup-9.png">

We will put a name to our integration.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VWSvKTN/setup-10.png">

In the Flows section, we must graphically connect the devices to the integration.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hmDpHWX/setup-11.png">

Once this is done we will go to Devices to obtain the credentials of our device.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/KXd8kNy/setup-14.png">

We save the DevEUI and AppEUI data as requested by our platform in Kharon.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/94NSMHn/setup-15.png">

We will add the credentials on the platform and select Add Device.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/183Bf7Q/setup-16.png">

If the device was added correctly, a success notification will appear at the top.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/XZVG1QQ/setup-17.png">

In the devices section we can get the Last message on the platform.

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/31FrkRs/setup-19-1.png">

Finally, clicking on the Transaction will open the solana explorer with the message that we are sending from the device.
